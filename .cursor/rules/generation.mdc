# Overall guidance 

## When creating new schema types
### Update structure.ts
When creating new Sanity schema document types you should ALWAYS add a corresponding `createList` call in the `structure.ts` file to allow the types to show in the structure builder menu. Do not use icons from @sanity/icons that do not exist.

### Place definitions in the proper folder
If the schema being generated is of type "document", put it in `apps/studio/schemaTypes/documents`
